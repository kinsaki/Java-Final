PROJECT TITLE: Zombie Defense
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Final Project
VERSION or DATE: v1.9
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Press 'Run'
AUTHORS: Devon Lucey
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Page one is the Player selection screen. Use the pointer to select a character (arrow keys).

You may chose from 2 players. Player one has a moderate damage rifle with high mobility and moderate range. Player two has a high damage plasma rifle which can kill a zombie in one hit but lacks range.  

The game starts with 3 zombies and a player. The player can move using the arrow keys and fire their weapon using the spacebar.

The object of the game is to survive as long as possible and kill as many zombies as possible. When the timer reaches 0 the player has won. 

If the player is harmed (touched) by a zombie they will die and the game will end. The game may also end if the player fails to kill enough zombies (score is negative). 

Zombies are worth 2 points per kill but if a zombie gets passed the player 1 point will be deducted from the score.
